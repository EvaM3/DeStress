                    Box breathing, also known as square breathing, is a simple yet powerful technique for improving concentration and relieving stress. Itâ€™s called box breathing because it consists of four equal parts, like a box: inhale, hold, exhale, and hold, each lasting for 4 seconds.

                    1. Inhale through your nose for 4 seconds.
                    2. Hold your breath for 4 seconds.
                    3. Exhale through your mouth for 4 seconds.
                    4. Hold your breath again for 4 seconds.

                    This technique is often used by athletes, Navy SEALs, and anyone looking to improve their performance under pressure.
